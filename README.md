# Space_Dodgers
Hello,
I am just a dude that wants to at some point make games. I decided to use python because it seemed easy to learn.
This is my first ever game made with pygame. I followed a Tech with Tim tutorial and tried to continue adding functionality with more success than I was expecting.
I used adobe illistrator to create the images.
This is also my first try at using GitHub so we shall see how this goes.
